    <h2>Welcome to SayThanks.io</h1>

    <p>SayThanks will exist as a thankfulness button/link/inbox for open source projects to add to their repositories and documentation â€” like a reverse mailing list for users to send little notes of thanks for building something awesome.</p>

    <p>
        This project will be open source, and is hosted
        <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/saythanks.io">on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
