    <h2>Spreading Thankfulness in Open Source&trade;</h2>

    <p>
        <em>saythanks.io</em> will provide a button/link for use by open
        source projects, to encourage users to send a simple thank you note to
        the creator (or creators) of that project.

    <p>
        This simple button/link can be addded to READMEs and project documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The author can then enjoy a nice inbox (ideally) filled with very small,
        thoughtful messages from the happy users of the software they enjoy to toil over.
    </p>
