# SayThanks.io: Thankfulness as a Service

SayThanks will exist as a thankfulness button/link/inbox for open source
projects to add to their repositories and documentation — like a reverse
mailing list for users to send little notes of thanks for building something
awesome.

## Implementation Concepts

- Flask for API and Frontend (possibly single-app)
- Stormpath for credential storage
- GitHub account creation (as well as manual username)
- Email a user when a new message of thankfulness is submitted (csrf enabled)
- Inbox page for each user/project with simple aggregation of messages (private).

## Potential Collaborators

- Tom Baker (Javascript)
- Tom Matthews (Logo and Graphic Design)
- me—hopefully not  (Frontned Design)

## Thanks.
